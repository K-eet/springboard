3. Replace Silicon Foundry logo placeholder with real logo asset
4. Add real LinkedIn URLs to team members
5. Set up Formspree account → get form ID → replace YOUR_FORM_ID in Contact.tsx
6. Add real partner logos to Partners section
7. Update metadata in layout.tsx (title, description)
8. Deploy to Vercel or Netlify

## Known Issues
(none)

## Placeholder inventory
- Hero headline: "Where bold ideas meet enterprise ambition." — replace with approved copy
- About copy: 3 paragraphs — replace with approved copy
- Services copy: Consulting + Ventures descriptions — replace with approved copy
- Partners copy: Silicon Foundry description — replace with approved copy
- Team: CEO name, bio, all 4 advisor names/titles/bios — replace with real data
- Contact copy — replace with approved copy
- Formspree ID: YOUR_FORM_ID — must be replaced before contact form works

## Notes
- Static export configured: `npm run build` produces /out directory ready for Vercel/Netlify
- All hover states use inline JS event handlers (components marked "use client" where needed)
- Sequoia Capital aesthetic fully implemented: cream bg, pill buttons/inputs, dark teal footer, uppercase nav

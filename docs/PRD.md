# PRD.md (Product Requirements Document)

## Overview

**Project Name:** Springboard Malaysia Corporate Website
**Project Type:** Static marketing website
**Client:** Springboard (consulting and ventures firm)
**Location:** Malaysia
**Timeline:** Prototype phase

## Purpose

The website exists to pass background scrutiny. When corporate executives Google "Springboard" after a meeting, pitch, or referral, the site must:
1. Confirm Springboard is a legitimate, professional operation
2. Showcase the Silicon Foundry (Kearney company) partnership
3. Display leadership and advisory team credentials
4. Clearly communicate the consulting + ventures business model
5. Provide a contact pathway

**This is NOT:**
- A lead generation funnel
- A startup accelerator site targeting founders
- A content marketing platform
- An e-commerce or SaaS product

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Corporate executives in Malaysia
- Innovation leads
- CTOs / Chief Digital Officers
- Procurement / vendor evaluation teams
- C-suite decision makers

**Psychographic profile:**
- Risk-averse, needs proof of credibility
- Will verify claims (LinkedIn, partner websites)
- Values professionalism over flash
- Skeptical of new/unknown vendors
- Looking for reasons to trust, not reasons to buy

## Success Criteria

1. A corporate executive landing on the site thinks "these people are legitimate"
2. Silicon Foundry partnership is immediately visible
3. Team credentials are verifiable (LinkedIn links work)
4. Site loads fast, works on mobile, looks professional
5. No "template" or "amateur" signals
